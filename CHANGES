New Features:
- A new button can be found on the Unraveling Sands in Remix, which will automatically fill the sands with unwanted items. The addon will not scrap items that are higher item level than what you have equipped. Additionally, it won't scrap Prismatic gems. Weapons that aren't applicable to your current specialization are automatically considered scrappable regardless of its item level.

Enhancements:
- The addon's settings menu has received a visual update. In addition to the visual, all of the addon's settings are now searchable.
- Renamed "Open Holiday Items" to "Open Containers" and added Cache of Infinite Treasure (the cache rewarded from quests in Remix) to the list of supported items.

Removals:
- The Dragonriding choice nodes are no longer configurable.

Fixes:
- Quests in a list should now respect a pause while the player is holding their SHIFT key.
