What's New
- Fixed an issue causing the wrong talent spell link to be printed when the second choice in selection nodes was chosen.
- Fixed an issue (hopefully) that allowed the Quest Mobs icon to remain on the nameplate even after the quest objective was completed.
- Players can now hold the SHIFT key to temporarily pause quest-related automation.
