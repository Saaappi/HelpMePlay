HelpMePlay is a World of Warcraft addon built to automate as many tasks in the game as possible. Players should free up their time vendoring items one-by-one, accepting/completing quests, and even selecting dialog options from NPCs. *All options are disabled by default!*

> Use <kbd>/hmp</kbd> to open the options or configure a keybind!

Enter Azeroth, grab some ale, and let HelpMePlay take care of the heavy lifting. Read on to learn more!

## Features

- **Adventure Maps** - Automates accepting quests from "adventure maps". These are found in Oribos, Boralus Harbor, Dazar'alor, and more!
- **Anima Powers** - Players can instruct HelpMePlay to take powers on their behalf, suggest powers to them, or be silent and do nothing.
- **Chromie Time** - Automates entering Chromie Time. HelpMePlay will enter the expansion the player selects in the options!
- **Cinematics** - Gracefully cancel *most* in-game cinematics and movies.
- **Dialog** - Automates selecting appropriate dialog from NPCs both at and before max level. Players can even add their own!
- **Emotes** - Don't remember which emote to use on the stones in Maldraxxus? HelpMePlay is capable of using the appropriate emote simply by targeting these stones.
- **Garrison Tables** - HelpMePlay can both build your Garrison outposts AND plot important BEGINNER structures in your Garrison. Not only that, it can also start the initial mission you receive shortly after starting Frostfire Ridge or Shadowmoon Valley.
- **Merchants** - Don't want to select "Learn" for individual spells from trainers? HelpMePlay can learn everything for you without breaking the bank! Additionally, HelpMePlay can automatically purchase quest items for you!
- **Player Choice** - There are moments in the game where players are given a choice (e.g. Story .vs. Threads of Fate), and HelpMePlay can make the decision for you. Take Threads of Fate as an example, HelpMePlay will automatically select Threads of Fate and enter "FATE" so you don't have to!
- **Quests** - HelpMePlay can accept and complete quests. In addition to that common feature, HelpMePlay can also automatically select quest rewards based on sell price OR item level upgrade. *Heirloom slots are automatically ignored.*
- **Queues** - Tired of missing your queue pops while you're AFK? HelpMePlay will accept the queue at lightning speed, granting you precious time to take care of the important things in life (like grabbing a drink for your dungeon ventures.)
- **Repairs** - Automatically repair your items in town before you head out to slay more gnolls!
- **Speech** - HelpMePlay can interact with the in-game world through NPC and system speech. For example, the trickster during "[The Games We Play](https://www.wowhead.com/quest=57870/the-games-we-play)" in Ardenweald, simply target the trickster, and HelpMePlay will automatically react to the trickster's speech. Enjoy some much deserved rest and relaxation!
- **War Mode** - The free 10%, or higher, experience gain is undeniably a boon to the leveling experience. When enabled, HelpMePlay will automatically opt the player into War Mode upon their next visit to Orgrimmar or Stormwind.

## Systems
- **Talent Systems** - Want to know the best path for [**The Box of Many Things**](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/box-of-many-things-torghast-talent-system-shadowlands) or the [**Cyphers of the First Ones**](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/cypher-of-the-first-ones-research-zereth-mortis-progression)? HelpMePlay can not only provide that path, but can also let you know when you're missing currency (and by how much!)
