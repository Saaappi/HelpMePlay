## Version 3.0.0B8.4 - 2024/07/01

### Added
- Added **Create Whisper Window** and **Create Loot Window** under the **New Character Configuration** section.
  - _**Author's Note:** These settings are used to quickly create a Whispers and Loot window on new characters for players that prefer to have their whisper and loot events separate from the General chat tab._
### Changed or Updated
- The World Event queue button is now movable. [Resolved #84]
- Heirlooms that are at the same level as the player will no longer be equipped.
  - _**Author's Note:** Heirlooms lose their benefit when the player's level is equal to the heirloom's level, not once the player's level is greater._
- Players can now hide Remix's gem/thread and scrap buttons without reloading the UI.
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with placing the Remix button at its new location once the player dragged it to their desired location on the screen.
