## Version 3.2.2 - 2024/10/22

### Added
- **Chromie Time**
  - _Dragonflight_ has been implemented in the dropdown as an expansion choice.
- **Mounts**
  - Added the [Mighty Caravan Brutosaur](https://www.wowhead.com/item=163042/reins-of-the-mighty-caravan-brutosaur) and the [Grizzly Hills Packmaster](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=457485) to the list of mounts to summon for a vendor.
- **World Events**
  - Added support for all Timewalking dungeon events in the EU region.
### Changed or Updated
- **Micro Button**
  - The button's position can now be locked in the settings. (This is enabled by default.)
- **Mounts**
  - Players can now hold SHIFT when above level 30 to use a normal flying mount when they don't want to use a skyriding mount.
    - _**Author's Note**: Bear in mind, the game still determines the flight style._
- **Quests**
  - When _None_ or _Sell Price_ are selected for Quest Rewards in the settings, all quests are now completed in combat. Similarly, when _Item Level_ is selected, quests without a reward are once again completed in combat; quests with at least one reward will prevent the quest from being completed while in combat.
- **Warband Bank**
  - The cap has been increased to **10,000**. The slider now moves in increments of 100 (up from 10).
- **World Events**
  - The minimum level requirement for all the Timewalking events has been reduced to 10 (down from 70).
  - The minimum level for Love is in the Air, Midsummer Fire Festival, Brewfest, and Hallow's End have been reduced to 10 (down from 70).
