## Version 3.2.2 - 2024/10/22

### Added
- **Mounts**
  - Added the [Mighty Caravan Brutosaur](https://www.wowhead.com/item=163042/reins-of-the-mighty-caravan-brutosaur) and the [Grizzly Hills Packmaster](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=457485) to the list of mounts to summon for a vendor.
### Changed or Updated
- **Micro Button**
  - The button's position can now be locked in the settings. (This is enabled by default.)
- **Mounts**
  - Players can now hold SHIFT when above level 30 to use a normal flying mount when they don't want to use a skyriding mount.
    - _**Author's Note**: Bear in mind, the game still determines the flight style._
- **Quests**
  - When _None_ or _Sell Price_ are selected for Quest Rewards in the settings, all quests are now completed in combat. Similarly, when _Item Level_ is selected, quests without a reward are once again completed in combat; quests with at least one reward will prevent the quest from being completed while in combat.
- **Warband Bank**
  - The cap has been increased to **10,000**. The slider now moves in increments of 100 (up from 10).
### Deprecated

### Fixed
- **Mounts**
  - When the Flight Style buff is removed from the player, the addon should no longer default to selecting a ground mount.
