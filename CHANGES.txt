New Features:
Junker

QoL Improvements:
	- Added a check button for Vehicles automation.
	- Added a dropdown menu to the Automations tab that allows the player to select how quest rewards are selected, if at all.
	
Additions:
	- Added weights for multiple quests in Zereth Mortis.
	- Added relatively general Torghast powers for all 3 Rogue specializations.
	- Added more Torghast dialogs.

Updates:
	- Updated the Calculate function to check for children reagents. For example, if a recipe calls for 2 Bolts of Linen Cloth, then the Calculate function will, in addition to 2 Bolts of Linen Cloth, return 4 Linen Cloth. It takes 2 Linen Cloth to make 1 Bolt.
	- Updated the Dialog command to allow players to use a gossip index. For example, if a creature has 4 dialog options, using "/hmp dialog 3" would add the text from the third dialog option from the given creature.
	- Updated Anima Power automation to select a random power if all available choices are unranked.
	
Fixes:
	- Fixed a problem with talent system perks that don't have prerequisite talents.
	- Fixed multiple problems with the Anima Power automation.
	- Fixed a problem where the quest popup would sometimes linger after accepting a quest from an item or from the call boards in major cities.
	- Fixed the Item Level and Sell Price logic in the quest reward automation to address multiple problems.
	- Fixed a problem with using gossip indices with the Dialog command on targets without a GUID. For example, using "/hmp dialog 1" on the orb that zones you into Blackwing Lair would return a literal 1 instead of the gossip. That's fixed now.
	
Removed:
	- Removed the Transmog keybind. This has been replaced with a button in the player's bags. (Users can still invoke /hmp transmog or /hmp t.)
