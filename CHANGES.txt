		- Fixed an issue that prevented the 'thank' emote during the "The Games We Play" quest in Ardenweald.
		- Fixed an issue that caused incomplete quests to take precedence over those that are complete.
		- Fixed an issue where dialog options had priority over quests.
		- Fixed an issue that prevented the pausing of the quest automations from taking effect when speaking with Gallywix on the boat in Zuldazar.
		- Fixed an issue for moments when a GUID wasn't available and dialog options were shown. (Fixes the gate to Ravencrest Cemetary in the Darkpens of Val'sharah.)
