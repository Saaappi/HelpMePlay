	New:
		Added an options panel. This panel is accessible by entering the addon's slash command (/hmp).
		Automated the adventure map for Shadowlands.
		Added the rest of the zones for the Battle for Azeroth maps for both factions.
		Added a dialog option for Aspirant Leda and Aspirant Ikaran, the two NPCs involved in the Suggested Reading quest in Bastion.
	Changes:
		The player must have at least 300 gold more than the cost of mount training or twice the cost of mount training for it to be automatically learned.
		Players can no longer hold modifier keys to pause Dialog automation, instead you must disable the Dialog setting.
		Players can no longer hold modifier keys to pause Player Choice automation (e.g. Threads or Story Mode), instead you must disable the corresponding setting.
		Players can no longer hold modifier keys to pause Quest automation, instead you must disable the corresponding setting.
		After conducting the emotes on the Runestones in Maldraxxus during the "Repeat After Me" quest, the gossip frame will be closed.
	Fixes:
		Fixed an issue with the player's covenant choice forcing Kyrian. This was the result of an issue with the PlayerChoice module.
		Fixed an issue with Nemea's confirmation in Bastion.
		Fixed an issue with multiple dialogs in Maldraxxus.
