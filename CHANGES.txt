HelpMePlay | 1.1.1
	New Features:
		- Added auto sharing to Party Play.
		- Added the ability to emote at targets rather than through gossip only.
	Fixes and Updates:
		- Fixed a bug that would cause the addon not to choose a quest reward if both items didn't belong to a slot and sold for the same amount. Quest rewards that fit this description are now chosen at random.
		- Fixed an issue where sometimes the quest window would remain open after completing a quest.
