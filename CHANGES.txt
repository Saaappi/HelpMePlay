HelpMePlay | 1.0.10
	New Features:
		- Added a feature that allows the addon to quickly exit documented vehicles. The fewer the buttons, the better.
		- Auto skipping cinematics is now a thing! Cinematics that, if skipped, cause problems (e.g. Tol Dagor's exit) are NOT skipped so you don't endlessly wander on a boat ride to your demise.
		- Added native support for every locale. Brazil, Mexico, France, Germany, Italy, Portugues, Russia, Korea, Taiwan, and China players rejoice!
		- Titanic Research (Horrific Visions) is now a supported talent NPC! If you don't know what to pick, let HelpMePlay tell you.
		- Added (even more) dialogs from Zereth Mortis. Are you ready for Patch 9.2? HelpMePlay sure is!
		- Added a reminder to return to Orgrimmar or Stormwind at level 20. We all forget about the War Mode bonus here and there. It's no big deal, right? ._.
		- Added support for all dialogs in the remaining 9.0 Covenant Sanctum campaigns. I hope you enjoy more time on Netflix!
	Fixes and Updates:
		- Fixed dialogs that previously worked on Exile's Reach and in Draenor. They didn't want to work because I broke them. My bad...
		- Fixed an issue with the Drafting Table in Gorgrond. Now you don't have to pick the Sparring Arena on your own.
		- Fixed an issue preventing HelpMePlay from auto placing your Barracks in the Garrison. Let's call the reason why, "suspicious circumstances."
		- Fixed an issue that caused an error to be thrown when using the Command Tables in Covenant Sanctums.
		- Fixed an issue preventing dialog from processing when the player has Quests automation disabled. <You and the NPC awkwardly stare at one another.>
		- The quest frame is no longer auto hidden when it's stuck. It was annoying to have the frame vanish in the middle of submitting quests, I know. I'm working on a new approach to this problem.
		- Added a "Disable All" fontstring next to its button. It's bad UI design if the player has to hover for initial information, so I'm sorry about that!
		- Bumped the TOC version to 90200 (from 90105) in preparation for Patch 9.2. NEW PATCH, LET'S GO!
