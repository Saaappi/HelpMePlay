HelpMePlay | 1.1.1
	Fixes and Updates:
		- Updated Party Play to include auto sharing quests.
		- Updated Quests to add an icon to enemies required for quests. This should only apply when using Blizzard's default nameplates.
		- Updated Emotes automation to include the ability to emote based on target OR gossip, opposed to gossip only.
		- Updated the settings menu so it can't be opened in combat.
		- Removed the Quest Rewards check button. This automation was rolled into the Quests automation.
		- Fixed a bug that would cause the addon not to choose a quest reward when all were non-gear items and sold for the same price. Rewards that fit this description are now chosen at random.
