New Features:
Junker

Fixes and Updates:
	- Updated the Calculate function to check for children reagents. For example, if a recipe calls for 2 Bolts of Linen Cloth, then the Calculate function will, in addition to 2 Bolts of Linen Cloth, return 4 Linen Cloth. It takes 2 Linen Cloth to make 1 Bolt.
	- Updated the Dialog command to allow players to use a gossip index. For example, if a creature has 4 dialog options, using "/hmp dialog 3" would add the text from the third dialog option from the given creature.
	- Added a check button for Vehicles automation.
	- Added weights for multiple quests in Zereth Mortis.
	- Added relatively general Torghast powers for all 3 Rogue specializations.
	- Added more Torghast dialogs.
	- Fixed an issue with talent system perks that don't have prerequisite talents.
	- Fixed multiple problems with the Anima Power automation.
