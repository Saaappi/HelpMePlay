	New Features:
		- Waypoints: When certain quests are accepted, 1 or more documented waypoints will be added to the map. (Only works if TomTom is installed and loaded.)
	Fixes and Updates:
		- Restored the previous behavior for Threads of Fate automation. If the player disables the feature, the addon will opt them into Story Mode.
		- Updated the settings descriptions to more accurately reflect their latest capabilities.
		- Updated the Mail automation to also collect items (in addition to gold.)
		- Updated the rules for purchasing skills from trainers. Players need only 50 gold more than the cost now.
